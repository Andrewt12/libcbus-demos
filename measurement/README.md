Simple C-Bus measurement app demonstrating the use of libcgate.

It transmits the temperature every 20 secconds on the C-Bus and can be displayed on an clipsal eDLT

Only requirement is a Dallis ds18b20 One wire temperature sensor

I use it on a OrangePi Zero, should work equally as well on any board that supports w1
